# Wink
Welcome to Wink, home of the cutest one-eyed animals you'll ever meet!
Wink is a full-stack MERN app that allows you to create and interact with digital pets.

Inspired by [Tamagotchi](https://tamagotchi.com/) and my one-eyed dog Roux. ❤️

## Technologies Used
- Mongo DB
- Express.js
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- Node.js
- Heroku

## Known Issues
- App is not mobile-friendly
- Hunger level does not change if pet has not been fed for a day or more

## Future Features
- Implement user authentication: animals can only be fed and edited by their owners
- Add toys/activities and happiness level: users can add toys and play with their pet to adjust happiness level
- Add a "pet of the day" on homepage: feature a different pet every day
- Create animations: ex. the animal "eats" food when it is fed
- Hunger/happiness bar styling: the progress bar will change colors based on how hungry/happy the animal is
- Utilize a 3rd-party API for more flexibility in animal creation
